## Sin function
  * You can also use the sin wave to ease animations
  * TODO : make a sine wave (remember, you can use `angleMode(DEGREES)`) 
  * TODO : use it to gradually change the colour/size in your previous sketches

## Map function
  * Re-maps a number from one range to another.
  * For example, calling map(2, 0, 10, 0, 100) returns 20. The first three arguments set the original value to 2 and the original range from 0 to 10. The last two arguments set the target range from 0 to 100. 20's position in the target range [0, 100] is proportional to 2's position in the original range [0, 10].
  * TODO : make a ellipse move in the center even if the mouse is moving all across the canvas

## Noise function
  * Perlin noise is a random sequence generator producing a more naturally ordered, harmonic succession of numbers compared to the standard random() function.
  * [Perlin noise reference](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/noise/)
  * TODO : Make a 1-D perlin noise space to change the size of an ellipse / make a wave
  * TODO : Make a 2-D perlin noise space to get a greyscale screen!
